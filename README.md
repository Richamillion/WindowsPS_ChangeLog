# WindowsPS_ChangeLog
Script to run during system Startup and Shutdown to capture software changes and export them for tracking and reporting. Recommended to run the startup and shutdown scripts via GPO. The script creates a startup.csv listing all currently installed software, the shutdown script will try to find the startup.csv in the "SOMEPATH" directory and compare any differences between the startup.csv and the currently installed software, exporting any differences to a changelog.csv. If a previous startup.csv cannot be found it will reference Windows Event Log for any period of time set (default 3 days) for any 1034 event codes and write those changes to a file. If no changes are found the script will write a .nochanges file. The shutdown script could be modified to send the list to an email or via an api call fairly easily. I may add these methods as commented lines in the future.
